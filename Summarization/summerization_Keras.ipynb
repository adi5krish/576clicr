       "context    Summary\\n\\nA 40 - year - old man presented with a BEG__progressively increasing swelling__END over the ventral aspect of the right wrist of 23 days duration following a BEG__laceration__END .\\nThe BEG__swelling__END was soft , pulsatile and was BEG__intermittently bleeding__END , with BEG__poor distal capillary filling__END and BEG__cold distal extremity__END .\\nClinically it was diagnosed as BEG__pseudoaneurysm of the radial artery__END and was sent for a BEG__duplex scan__END for confirmation .\\nThe BEG__lesion ruptured__END in the radiology department before the BEG__scan__END was done , and the patient went into BEG__hypovolaemia__END .\\nIn view of this , the patient underwent BEG__exploration__END of the BEG__pseudoaneurysm under brachial block__END , and the radial artery was found to be transected just proximal to the dorsal branch .\\nIt was decided to repair the artery as there was no evidence of adequate circulation supply or the patency of the ulnar artery preoperatively .\\nBEG__Doppler study__END at 15 and 45 days postoperatively showed good flow through , with no evidence of BEG__thrombus__END .\\n\\nBACKGROUND\\n\\nBEG__Pseudoaneurysms occur rarely in the radial artery__END .\\nAlmost all the cases reported to date have been secondary to BEG__radial artery cannulation__END or BEG__puncture__END for various indications .\\nThere have been very few reported cases of BEG__spontaneous rupture of false aneurysm of the radial artery__END .\\nWe report a case of a BEG__pseudoaneurysm of the radial artery__END occurring secondary to a BEG__laceration over the right wrist__END sustained while working in the garden ; the BEG__pseudoaneurysm__END ruptured spontaneously .\\nBEG__False aneurysm of the radial artery__END , other than that due to a BEG__direct iatrogenic puncture__END or associated with BEG__fracture of bones__END , is not thought to have been reported in the literature .\\nBEG__Spontaneous rupture of these lesions__END has been reported extremely rarely in the literature .\\n\\nCASE PRESENTATION\\n\\nA 40 - year - old man presented to us with a history of a soft , expanding , BEG__pulsatile mass over the right wrist__END , of 23 days duration .\\nHe had suffered from BEG__laceration over the wrist__END around a month earlier , and this had been sutured at a peripheral hospital .\\nHe noticed the BEG__swelling__END around a week later and it continued to increase in size , with BEG__progressive difficulty in extension of the wrist__END .\\nHe started to BEG__bleed from the lesion__END intermittently after the BEG__sutures__END were removed .\\nHe consulted the local hospital and was treated conservatively .\\nAt this time he decided to come to us .\\n\\nOn BEG__examination__END , a soft , globular , BEG__pulsatile mass__END of 5 × 4 cm ( fig 1 ) with BEG__eroded skin__END in some areas was noted over the right wrist on the ventral aspect .\\nThe wrist was in a slightly flexed and ulnar deviated position .\\nA “ T ” BEG__shaped scar__END with BEG__suture marks__END could also be made out .\\nBEG__Proximal pressure__END over the radial artery made the BEG__swelling non-pulsatile__END .\\nBEG__Ulnar artery pulsation__END could not be felt .\\nBEG__Capillary filling time__END was BEG__sluggish in right finger tips__END in comparison with the left , and the hand felt BEG__cold__END even though finger movements were present .\\nA provisional diagnosis of BEG__false aneurysm of the radial artery__END was made and the patient was sent to the radiology department for a BEG__duplex scan__END .\\n\\nThe BEG__false aneurysm__END ruptured in the radiology department before a BEG__duplex scan__END could be performed , and the patient went into BEG__hypovolaemia__END due to BEG__bleeding__END .\\nWe decided to operate and explore in view of the BEG__rupture__END , without the BEG__duplex scan__END report ( fig 2 ) .\\n\\nBEG__TREATMENT__END\\n\\nBEG__Exploration__END was done under brachial block with back - up for general anaesthesia , with a BEG__pneumatic tourniquet__END .\\nThe proximal radial artery was exposed by BEG__vertical incision over the lower part of forearm__END , and skeletonised .\\nThe artery distal to the BEG__aneurysm__END was also exposed and skeletonised .\\nThe BEG__aneurysm sac__END was excised and BEG__clots__END removed , and this revealed transaction of the radial artery just proximal to the dorsal branch at the wrist .\\nBEG__Profuse bleeding__END was noted from both ends on release of the tourniquet .\\nProximal and distal vascular control was achieved by bulldog vascular clamps after heparinising both ends of the transected artery .\\nThe radial artery was repaired using 6 / 0 prolene with BEG__interrupted sutures__END , and flow was restored on BEG__release of the bulldog vascular clamps__END ( fig 3 ) .\\nThe skin was repaired with interrupted 1 / 0 BEG__prolene sutures__END .\\nThe BEG__aneurysm sac__END was sent for BEG__culture and sensitivity__END .\\n\\nOUTCOME AND FOLLOW - UP\\n\\nThe patient was continued on BEG__heparin injections__END for 2 days postoperatively , and discharged on BEG__oral warfarin__END on the fifth postoperative day ( POD ) . BEG__Sutures__END were removed on 10th POD .\\nA BEG__Doppler study__END on 15th POD showed BEG__weak flow through the anastomosis__END and a BEG__patent small ulnar artery__END .\\nThe BEG__capillary filling__END improved and the BEG__temperature__END of both hands was equal .\\nWrist and finger movements were BEG__pain__END free without any restrictions .\\nBEG__Repeat Doppler study__END at 2 weeks and at 1.5 month follow - up showed good flow through the radial artery and maintenance of patency .\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nA BEG__false aneurysm__END is usually described as a BEG__pulsating haematoma__END that communicates with an artery through a BEG__disruption in the arterial wall__END .\\nThere is no BEG__fixed definition but false aneurysms__END are irreversible and at least 50 % larger than the normal arterial diameter .\\n1 The radial artery is most affected at the distal part where it lies superficially .\\nBEG__Traumatic pseudoaneurysms__END may occur acutely or , more commonly , they may be discovered following BEG__unrecognised arterial injury .\\nMany false aneurysms of the radial artery__END have been reported recently and most often they are localised in an area of BEG__arterial puncture__END or BEG__cannulation__END .\\nOne - third of cases in a BEG__series__END presented with BEG__rupture__END requiring urgent opertion .\\nControversy exists regarding the BEG__treatment alternatives__END for BEG__pseudoaneurysm of radial artery__END , and BEG__reconstruction__END with BEG__interposition graft__END has been advocated .\\nBEG__Ligation__END of the artery is an alternative to BEG__end - to - end anastomosis__END in situations where there is a dual root of supply ( eg , in wrist and leg ) , demonstration of good collaterals in BEG__angiography__END , and excellent back BEG__bleeding from distal stump__END .\\n6 A BEG__compression bandage__END , especially for children , offers an alternative to BEG__surgical procedure__END .\\nBEG__Pseudoaneurysms__END less than 2 cm in diameter have a 70 % likelihood of BEG__spontaneous thrombosis__END with BEG__compression therapy__END , whereas larger ones and those in anticoagulated patients are likely to persist .\\nBEG__Percutaneous thrombin injection__END has become an effective and alternative treatment option since the last decade .\\nBEG__Radial artery pseudoaneurysm__END can also occur following missed BEG__traumatic lacerations__END other than BEG__iatrogenic arterial puncture__END .\\nWe decided to reconstruct the artery by achieving BEG__end - to - end anastomosis__END , as distal vascularity was jeopardised and we did not have BEG__documentary evidence of circulation through the ulnar artery__END .\\nWe believe that BEG__reconstruction__END should be attempted , especially in situations where distal vascularity is in doubt , even in areas where there are BEG__dual roots of circulation and adequate back bleeding from the distal stump__END .\n",

                                                                               Summary\\n\\nThis report describes a term newborn with BEG__isolated distortion in the left parietal bone__END without any BEG__other visible congenital anomaly__END , due to BEG__amniotic band disruption__END .\\nA BEG__skull x-ray__END , BEG__ultrasound scan__END and BEG__subsequent MRI scan of the brain__END did not show any BEG__apparent distortion__END apart from BEG__depression__END and BEG__concavity in the left parietal bone__END .\\nThe purpose of this case report is to raise awareness of this possible , mild outcome of this BEG__little - known entity__END , which may BEG__mimic caput succedaneum__END ( moulding of the presenting part in the birth canal during natural delivery ) , and to provide a historical and embryological background .\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nBEG__Amniotic band disruption syndrome__END is a rare entity which occurs in 1 in 1200 to 1 in 15 000 live births .\\n1 It may cause a BEG__myriad of deformities of fetal body parts__END from BEG__mild defects in limbs to severe craniofacial defects__END incompatible with life .\\nThe BEG__spectrum of defects__END includes BEG__disruption__END , BEG__deformation__END and BEG__malformation__END of different body parts due to interference from the BEG__amniotic bands at different stages of organogenesis__END .\\n2 The BEG__syndrome__END is also described as ADAM complex ( for ‘ BEG__amniotic deformities__END , BEG__adhesions__END , mutilation ’ ) or BEG__amniotic band disruption complex__END ( ABDC ) for its nature of presentation .\\nSince BEG__Tropin__END described the condition in 1968 , 3 many questions regarding this BEG__syndrome__END remain unanswered because of its rarity and complex mechanism .\\nThis case is unique in its presentation as it BEG__mimics caput succedaneum__END without any BEG__neurological defect__END .\\nThis type of presentation has not been described before in the medical literature .\\n\\nCase presentation\\n\\nA girl , born at 38 weeks of gestation by vaginal delivery of normal duration of labour , presented with a BEG__large caput over the left parietal region__END ( figure 1A , B ) .\\nThe mother was a 32 - year - old primigravida without any BEG__significant medical illness__END .\\nThere was no family history of BEG__consanguinity__END or BEG__chronic illness__END .\\nThe pregnancy was uneventful and BEG__antenatal scans__END were reported as normal .\\nThe mother had a history of BEG__premature rupture__END of the membrane of more than 24 h and had BEG__prophylactic antibiotics__END .\\nThe baby did not cry immediately after birth .\\nThe BEG__Apgar score__END at 1 min was 5 , and this increased to 9 after five inflation breaths .\\nHer BEG__blood sugar__END was 6.1 mmol / litre .\\nHer BEG__birth weight__END was 1960 g ( 9th to 25th centile ) and BEG__head circumference__END was 29 cm ( 9th centile ) .\\nShe was pink , handling well and moving all her limbs spontaneously .\\nHer BEG__oxygen saturation__END on air was 99 % .\\nShe did not have any BEG__respiratory distress__END , BEG__visible congenital anomaly__END or BEG__audible cardiac murmur__END .\\nThere was no BEG__frontal bossing__END , BEG__ear abnormality__END or BEG__hypertelorism__END .\\nBEG__Musculoskeletal and neurological examination of the baby__END was normal .\\nThe craniofacial contours of the parents were unremarkable .\\n\\nThe BEG__circumference of the asymmetric swelling of the scalp__END was 26 cm .\\nA BEG__clear wide demarcation line__END was present between the BEG__swelling__END and the vessels of the scalp .\\nThe skin over the BEG__swelling__END appeared darker than the rest of the scalp .\\nBEG__Cranial sutures__END including the BEG__saggital suture__END could not be felt due to the BEG__swelling__END .\\nThe newborn was given BEG__nasogastric feeding__END and BEG__intravenous cefotaxime__END .\\n\\nInvestigations\\n\\nHer BEG__blood investigations__END were all within normal limits .\\nA BEG__skull x-ray__END showed BEG__moulding of the skull bone over the left parietotemporal region__END ( figures 2 and 3 ) .\\nNo BEG__overriding or fracture__END was found except BEG__soft tissue swelling__END overlying the vertex .\\nAn BEG__ultrasound scan of the brain__END showed symmetrical lateral ventricles in both hemispheres with falx at the midline .\\nA BEG__collection of fluid__END of 0.7 – 1 cm in diameter was found over the calvaria , which was suggestive of BEG__caput succedaneum__END .\\n\\nA BEG__subsequent MRI__END showed the left hemicranium was distorted with BEG__relative preservation on the right side__END ( figure 4 ) .\\nThere was some BEG__concavity of the right parietal bone__END at the edge of BEG__caput succedaneum__END and BEG__similar inbowing of the lateral cranium on the left side__END , which was suggestive of modelling by an BEG__amniotic band__END .\\n\\nDifferential diagnosis\\n\\nBEG__Treatment__END\\n\\nOutcome and follow - up\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThough the exact aetiology of ABDC is unknown , two main pathogenetic mechanisms are proposed .\\nExogenous theory suggests BEG__early amnion rupture__END leading to a BEG__fibrous band__END that can entrap fetal body part ( figure 5 ) .\\nThe endogenous theory suggests BEG__vascular__END compromise .\\nGenetic factors might operate in some cases .\\n\\nMoerman et al described three types of BEG__lesions__END in this complex : ( A ) BEG__constrictive tissue bands__END ( BEG__shrivelled amniotic strands ) , ( B ) amniotic adhesions__END ( fusion between disrupted body part and intact amniotic membrane ) and ( C ) limb – body wall complex .\\n6 According to their observations , most of the BEG__craniofacial defects__END occur as a result of a BEG__vascular disruption sequence__END with or without BEG__cephaloamniotic adhesions__END , unlike the case described here that had the clear mark of a constriction band without BEG__significant vascular compromise__END .\\n\\nAn accurate diagnosis may be achieved by looking for the major features of BEG__amniotic band syndrome__END , and a BEG__routine chromosome study__END and BEG__placental examination__END in cases with BEG__multiple congenital anomalies__END .\\n27\\n\\nThough encephalocele , clefts , BEG__distortion__END and BEG__dislocation of craniofacial structures__END have been described as presentations of BEG__craniofacial defect__END related to this BEG__syndrome__END in the medical literature , 5 BEG__distorted hemicranium__END ( BEG__mimicking caput succedaneum__END ) without any BEG__neurological defect__END has never been described previously .\\nThe outcome of the BEG__syndrome__END depends on the gravity of BEG__malformation__END .\\nTermination of pregnancy is considered in cases of severe craniofacial or BEG__visceral abnormality__END .\\nSuccessful limb salvage by fetoscopic release of an BEG__amniotic band__END has been reported .\\nMost of the BEG__minor craniofacial defects__END require BEG__multiple surgical procedures__END to restore function , with BEG__significant compromise to satisfactory cosmesis__END .\n",

Summary\\n\\nA 40 - year - old man presented with a BEG__progressively increasing swelling__END over the ventral aspect of the right wrist of 23 days duration following a BEG__laceration__END .\\nThe BEG__swelling__END was soft , pulsatile and was BEG__intermittently bleeding__END , with BEG__poor distal capillary filling__END and BEG__cold distal extremity__END .\\nClinically it was diagnosed as BEG__pseudoaneurysm of the radial artery__END and was sent for a BEG__duplex scan__END for confirmation .\\nThe BEG__lesion ruptured__END in the radiology department before the BEG__scan__END was done , and the patient went into BEG__hypovolaemia__END .\\nIn view of this , the patient underwent BEG__exploration__END of the BEG__pseudoaneurysm under brachial block__END , and the radial artery was found to be transected just proximal to the dorsal branch .\\nIt was decided to repair the artery as there was no evidence of adequate circulation supply or the patency of the ulnar artery preoperatively .\\nBEG__Doppler study__END at 15 and 45 days postoperatively showed good flow through , with no evidence of BEG__thrombus__END .\\n\\nBACKGROUND\\n\\nBEG__Pseudoaneurysms occur rarely in the radial artery__END .\\nAlmost all the cases reported to date have been secondary to BEG__radial artery cannulation__END or BEG__puncture__END for various indications .\\nThere have been very few reported cases of BEG__spontaneous rupture of false aneurysm of the radial artery__END .\\nWe report a case of a BEG__pseudoaneurysm of the radial artery__END occurring secondary to a BEG__laceration over the right wrist__END sustained while working in the garden ; the BEG__pseudoaneurysm__END ruptured spontaneously .\\nBEG__False aneurysm of the radial artery__END , other than that due to a BEG__direct iatrogenic puncture__END or associated with BEG__fracture of bones__END , is not thought to have been reported in the literature .\\nBEG__Spontaneous rupture of these lesions__END has been reported extremely rarely in the literature .\\n\\nCASE PRESENTATION\\n\\nA 40 - year - old man presented to us with a history of a soft , expanding , BEG__pulsatile mass over the right wrist__END , of 23 days duration .\\nHe had suffered from BEG__laceration over the wrist__END around a month earlier , and this had been sutured at a peripheral hospital .\\nHe noticed the BEG__swelling__END around a week later and it continued to increase in size , with BEG__progressive difficulty in extension of the wrist__END .\\nHe started to BEG__bleed from the lesion__END intermittently after the BEG__sutures__END were removed .\\nHe consulted the local hospital and was treated conservatively .\\nAt this time he decided to come to us .\\n\\nOn BEG__examination__END , a soft , globular , BEG__pulsatile mass__END of 5 × 4 cm ( fig 1 ) with BEG__eroded skin__END in some areas was noted over the right wrist on the ventral aspect .\\nThe wrist was in a slightly flexed and ulnar deviated position .\\nA “ T ” BEG__shaped scar__END with BEG__suture marks__END could also be made out .\\nBEG__Proximal pressure__END over the radial artery made the BEG__swelling non-pulsatile__END .\\nBEG__Ulnar artery pulsation__END could not be felt .\\nBEG__Capillary filling time__END was BEG__sluggish in right finger tips__END in comparison with the left , and the hand felt BEG__cold__END even though finger movements were present .\\nA provisional diagnosis of BEG__false aneurysm of the radial artery__END was made and the patient was sent to the radiology department for a BEG__duplex scan__END .\\n\\nThe BEG__false aneurysm__END ruptured in the radiology department before a BEG__duplex scan__END could be performed , and the patient went into BEG__hypovolaemia__END due to BEG__bleeding__END .\\nWe decided to operate and explore in view of the BEG__rupture__END , without the BEG__duplex scan__END report ( fig 2 ) .\\n\\nBEG__TREATMENT__END\\n\\nBEG__Exploration__END was done under brachial block with back - up for general anaesthesia , with a BEG__pneumatic tourniquet__END .\\nThe proximal radial artery was exposed by BEG__vertical incision over the lower part of forearm__END , and skeletonised .\\nThe artery distal to the BEG__aneurysm__END was also exposed and skeletonised .\\nThe BEG__aneurysm sac__END was excised and BEG__clots__END removed , and this revealed transaction of the radial artery just proximal to the dorsal branch at the wrist .\\nBEG__Profuse bleeding__END was noted from both ends on release of the tourniquet .\\nProximal and distal vascular control was achieved by bulldog vascular clamps after heparinising both ends of the transected artery .\\nThe radial artery was repaired using 6 / 0 prolene with BEG__interrupted sutures__END , and flow was restored on BEG__release of the bulldog vascular clamps__END ( fig 3 ) .\\nThe skin was repaired with interrupted 1 / 0 BEG__prolene sutures__END .\\nThe BEG__aneurysm sac__END was sent for BEG__culture and sensitivity__END .\\n\\nOUTCOME AND FOLLOW - UP\\n\\nThe patient was continued on BEG__heparin injections__END for 2 days postoperatively , and discharged on BEG__oral warfarin__END on the fifth postoperative day ( POD ) . BEG__Sutures__END were removed on 10th POD .\\nA BEG__Doppler study__END on 15th POD showed BEG__weak flow through the anastomosis__END and a BEG__patent small ulnar artery__END .\\nThe BEG__capillary filling__END improved and the BEG__temperature__END of both hands was equal .\\nWrist and finger movements were BEG__pain__END free without any restrictions .\\nBEG__Repeat Doppler study__END at 2 weeks and at 1.5 month follow - up showed good flow through the radial artery and maintenance of patency .\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nA BEG__false aneurysm__END is usually described as a BEG__pulsating haematoma__END that communicates with an artery through a BEG__disruption in the arterial wall__END .\\nThere is no BEG__fixed definition but false aneurysms__END are irreversible and at least 50 % larger than the normal arterial diameter .\\n1 The radial artery is most affected at the distal part where it lies superficially .\\nBEG__Traumatic pseudoaneurysms__END may occur acutely or , more commonly , they may be discovered following BEG__unrecognised arterial injury .\\nMany false aneurysms of the radial artery__END have been reported recently and most often they are localised in an area of BEG__arterial puncture__END or BEG__cannulation__END .\\nOne - third of cases in a BEG__series__END presented with BEG__rupture__END requiring urgent opertion .\\nControversy exists regarding the BEG__treatment alternatives__END for BEG__pseudoaneurysm of radial artery__END , and BEG__reconstruction__END with BEG__interposition graft__END has been advocated .\\nBEG__Ligation__END of the artery is an alternative to BEG__end - to - end anastomosis__END in situations where there is a dual root of supply ( eg , in wrist and leg ) , demonstration of good collaterals in BEG__angiography__END , and excellent back BEG__bleeding from distal stump__END .\\n6 A BEG__compression bandage__END , especially for children , offers an alternative to BEG__surgical procedure__END .\\nBEG__Pseudoaneurysms__END less than 2 cm in diameter have a 70 % likelihood of BEG__spontaneous thrombosis__END with BEG__compression therapy__END , whereas larger ones and those in anticoagulated patients are likely to persist .\\nBEG__Percutaneous thrombin injection__END has become an effective and alternative treatment option since the last decade .\\nBEG__Radial artery pseudoaneurysm__END can also occur following missed BEG__traumatic lacerations__END other than BEG__iatrogenic arterial puncture__END .\\nWe decided to reconstruct the artery by achieving BEG__end - to - end anastomosis__END , as distal vascularity was jeopardised and we did not have BEG__documentary evidence of circulation through the ulnar artery__END .\\nWe believe that BEG__reconstruction__END should be attempted , especially in situations where distal vascularity is in doubt , even in areas where there are BEG__dual roots of circulation and adequate back bleeding from the distal stump__END .\n",

event__END that exposes mother and fetus to potentially lethal risks .\\nDuring pregnancy , BEG__hepatic decompensation__END could suffice and the development of BEG__hepatic failure__END and BEG__encephalopathy__END could occur .\\nThe incidence of BEG__obstetric complications__END is also increased with a BEG__high rate of pre-eclampsia__END , BEG__postpartum bleeding__END , BEG__preterm delivery__END and BEG__stillbirth__END .\\nWe report a case of a 27 - year - old woman with BEG__autoimmune hepatitis__END and BEG__liver cirrhosis__END complicated by BEG__splenomegaly__END , BEG__oesophageal varices__END and BEG__severe thrombocytopaenia__END .\\nDuring pregnancy , close clinical and analytical surveillance was performed .\\nShe was medicated with BEG__corticosteroids__END , BEG__azathioprine__END and BEG__propranolol__END .\\nAt the 25th week of gestation , an BEG__upper gastrointestinal endoscopy__END was performed to control BEG__oesophageal varices__END .\\nThis patient had an uneventful pregnancy until 37 weeks .\\nAt 37th week of gestation , after BEG__spontaneous rupture of membranes__END , signs of BEG__acute fetal distress__END were observed , and an BEG__urgent caesarean__END was performed .\\nGood neonatal and maternal outcomes were achieved .\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nBEG__Autoimmune hepatitis__END ( AIH ) is a BEG__rare liver disease__END , diagnosed in women of childbearing age , 1 , 2 that could lead to BEG__liver cirrhosis__END .\\nHowever , a good therapeutic response is usually achieved resulting in a more benign clinical course .\\nReports regarding pregnancy exist from as early as the 1970s .\\nEarly published series reported unfavourable outcomes with a BEG__high incidence of obstetric complications4__END : BEG__fetal loss__END , BEG__severe pre-eclampsia__END , BEG__prematurity__END , BEG__fetal growth restriction__END , high rate of caesarean delivery and BEG__AIH flares__END , which could lead to BEG__hepatic failure__END and BEG__death__END .\\nThe maternal and fetal outcomes recently reported are much more favourable , secondary to better clinical management of this BEG__disorder__END .\\n4 , 7 – 10 The risks associated with pregnancy with BEG__chronic liver diseases__END are increased when BEG__cirrhosis__END and BEG__portal hypertension__END are present .\\n11 BEG__Rupture of oesophageal varices__END is the most fearful event in pregnant women with BEG__cirrhosis__END , representing the leading cause of death in these patients .\\nThese patients usually also need BEG__medical treatment__END with BEG__immune modulating drugs__END , such as BEG__azathioprine__END , the BEG__safety profile__END of which , during pregnancy , is not yet fully defined .\\n14\\n\\nWe report a case of an AIH patient with BEG__severe liver disease__END , complicated by BEG__cirrhosis__END and BEG__portal hypertension__END .\\nThis case highlights the importance of BEG__expert obstetrical care__END , including regular medical assessments , during and after pregnancy .\\n\\nCase presentation\\n\\nWe report a case of a 27 - year - old woman with BEG__AIH__END diagnosed during her infancy .\\nDiagnosis had been performed based on clinical presentation , BEG__elevated serum transaminases__END , BEG__hypergammaglobulinaemia__END , BEG__circulating autoantibodies__END ( BEG__positive antinuclear antibodies__END ) , presence of BEG__chronic active hepatitis__END on as an BEG__liver biopsy__END ( it was described interface BEG__hepatitis__END with BEG__lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates__END , BEG__piecemeal necrosis__END and BEG__lobular necroinflammatory activity__END ) and response to BEG__immunosuppressive therapy__END ; and absence of BEG__viral markers__END for BEG__hepatitis B__END and BEG__C__END , history of exposure to hepatic toxics or markers of BEG__genetic liver disorders__END .\\nThe patient fulfilled the criteria for a definitive AIH diagnosis according to the European Association for the BEG__Study of the Liver__END .\\n15 Her medical history was noteworthy forhistologically confirmed BEG__cirrhosis__END of 5 - year duration ( figures 1 – 3 ) , complicated by BEG__portal hypertension__END with evidence of BEG__oesophageal and rectal varices__END , BEG__splenomegaly__END and BEG__severe thrombocytopaenia__END .\\nAn episode of BEG__acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding__END occurred 4 years before pregnancy — it was controlled using BEG__local endoscopic treatment__END .\\nThe patient was a primipara , with menarche at the age of 14 years .\\nShe also had a history of BEG__oligomenorrhoea__END .\\n\\nBEG__Fibrous septa ( coloured in blue ) involving regenerative hepatic parenchymal nodules__END , observed in cirrhotic stage of BEG__hepatic disease__END ( Masson 's trichrome , × 100 ) .\\n\\nHer pregnancy had not been planned , so the first obstetric appointment occurred at the 7th week of pregnancy .\\nShe had no signs of BEG__liver decompensation__END at the BEG__initial physical examination__END .\\nShe was medicated with BEG__propranolol__END ( 40 mg three times a day ) , BEG__azathioprine__END ( 100 mg / day ) , BEG__ranitidine__END ( 300 mg / day ) and BEG__prednisolone__END ( 5 mg / day ) .\\nThe risks related to a pregnancy with AIH complicated with BEG__cirrhosis__END , BEG__portal hypertension__END and BEG__severe thrombocytopaenia__END were explained to her .\\nShe decided to keep the pregnancy , continuing BEG__all chronic medication__END , including BEG__azathioprine__END .\\nBEG__Folic acid supplementation__END was added .\\n\\nBEG__Initial laboratory tests__END were : BEG__aspartate aminotransferase__END ( AST ) 26 IU / L ( reference value ( RV ) : 10 – 30 IU / L ) , BEG__alanine aminotransferase__END ( ALT ) 13 IU / L ( RV : 10 – 36 IU / L ) , BEG__c - glutamyl - transferase__END 31 IU / L ( RV : 6 – 39 IU / L ) , BEG__total bilirubin__END 1.65 mg / dL ( RV : 0.20 – 1.00 mg / dL ) , BEG__direct bilirubin__END 0.41 mg / dL ( RV : 0 – 0.20 mg / dL ) , haemoglobin 12.3 g / dL ( RV : 12 – 15 g / dL ) , BEG__thrombocytopaenia__END 35 000 / µL ( RV : 150 000 – 400 000 / µL ) , BEG__prolonged prothrombin__END time ( BEG__PT__END ) 13.2 s ( RV : 11.3 s ) and BEG__positive antinuclear antibodies__END .\\n\\nBEG__Obstetric surveillance__END with BEG__regular liver function evaluation__END was performed ( figure 4 ) .\\nDuring the third trimester , BEG__periodic fetal evaluation__END showed that the fetus was growing accordingly to what was expected , and the BEG__amniotic fluid__END and BEG__umbilical artery Doppler indexes__END were always in the normal range for gestational age .\\n\\nThroughout the pregnancy , BEG__transaminases__END remained within normal range , and BEG__total bilirubin__END and BEG__direct bilirubin__END remained BEG__slightly elevated__END , within the usual patient values .\\nBEG__Severe thrombocytopaenia__END does not exacerbate during pregnancy .\\nAn BEG__oesophagogastroduodenoscopy__END ( OGD ) was performed at 25 weeks of gestation to evaluate the BEG__oesophageal varices__END .\\nIt revealed BEG__hypertensive gastropathy__END with a BEG__marbled pattern in the gastric body__END , and fundus and a BEG__small varicose vein__END in the lower 1 / 3 of the oesophagus , but without indication for BEG__local treatment__END .\\nThese findings were similar to the previous OGD performed before the patient 's pregnancy ( figures 5 and 6 ) .\\n\\nAt 37 weeks of gestation , she was electively admitted to prepare for delivery .\\nAfter a BEG__spontaneous rupture of membranes__END , BEG__fetal monitoring__END showed BEG__signs of distress__END ( BEG__spontaneous severe repetitive decelerations__END ) .\\nAn BEG__urgent caesarean section__END was performed under general anaesthesia .\\nBefore the delivery , the BEG__patient 's platelet count__END was 33 000 / L , so a BEG__platelet transfusion__END ( 2 units ) was performed preoperatively , to minimise the risk of BEG__haemorrhage__END .\\nA healthy newborn was born , weighing 2550 g , with an BEG__Apgar score__END of 7 at the first and 8 at the fifth minute .\\nThe cause of the BEG__abnormal non-stress test__END was a BEG__tight cervical cord__END .\\nBEG__Tube ligation__END was performed as per the patient 's wishes .\\nThe BEG__placental histological evaluation__END was accordant with the gestational age , without BEG__pathological signs__END .\\n\\nThe postpartum developed without BEG__complications__END , with BEG__AST__END , BEG__ALT and other hepatic function tests__END within normal range even 6 weeks after birth .\\nTo reduce the probability of a BEG__postpartum flare__END , BEG__prednisolone dosage__END was increased to 10 mg / day during the first month of puerperium .\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThe clinical course of BEG__AIH__END during pregnancy is unpredictable , 16 and the BEG__ideal management__END and BEG__treatment__END of pregnant women with BEG__cirrhosis__END and BEG__portal hypertension__END is still unclear .\\nClinical improvement has been reported , however , pregnancy in these patients could be associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes .\\n4 , 7 – 10 BEG__Disease flares__END are usually associated with poor control in the year preceding pregnancy and the absence of BEG__therapy__END during gestation .\\nA reduction in the live birth rate has been reported in patients with BEG__cirrhosis__END , 8 with BEG__obstetric complications__END present in nearly half of these cases .\\n13\\n\\nBEG__Gastrointestinal bleeding__END is the BEG__most serious complication__END in these patients , it occurs in up to 50 % of pregnancies with BEG__cirrhosis__END and BEG__portal hypertension__END .\\n18 It is more frequent in the second half of gestation and during delivery , because maximum blood volume is achieved and the larger uterus causes elevation of BEG__venous pressure__END due to BEG__compression of the inferior vena cava__END .\\n12 , 18\\n\\nAll patients with BEG__cirrhosis__END , even without BEG__varices__END before pregnancy , should undergo OGD for BEG__assessment__END of BEG__varices in the second trimester__END .\\n13 To decrease BEG__portal hypertension__END and to reduce the probability of BEG__bleeding__END , BEG__propranolol__END can be used ( FDA category C ) , taking into account the risk of BEG__fetal growth restriction__END .\\n13\\n\\nAIH activity is often improved during pregnancy , however , most patients require BEG__pharmacological treatment__END to keep clinical stability or to treat BEG__flares__END .\\n19 BEG__Corticosteroid therapy__END and BEG__azathioprine__END remain the mainstay of BEG__medical treatment__END of BEG__AIH__END .\\nBEG__Corticosteroids__END are considered safe during pregnancy but are associated with an BEG__increased incidence of cleft palate__END when used during the first trimester .\\n19 BEG__Azathioprine__END safety is classically less certain because it has been linked to BEG__congenital malformations in animals__END , and BEG__anaemia__END and BEG__myelosuppression__END .\\n14 However , the expanding experience of its use in women with BEG__other autoimmune disorders__END and after BEG__heterologous transplantation__END shows that BEG__azathioprine__END is also a BEG__safe drug__END to use during gestation , and probably during breastfeeding as well .\\n19\\n\\nThe mode of BEG__delivery__END is controversial , however , some authors consider that the BEG__rise in abdominal pressure in vaginal delivery__END using BEG__Valsalva manoeuvres__END BEG__increases portal hypertension__END and the BEG__risk of bleeding__END , that is the reason caesarean delivery is recommended .\\n20\\n\\nAIH is not a contraindication for pregnancy , and satisfactory maternal and BEG__neonatal outcomes__END can be achieved .\\nFor this , pregnancy must occur when the AIH is silent and medically under control at conception .\\nAdditionally , the outcome strongly depends on the severity of BEG__organ dysfunction__END at the beginning of pregnancy .\\nTo recap , disease control before pregnancy , correct BEG__evaluation__END of BEG__organ dysfunction__END and BEG__expert obstetrical care__END with regular assessment are essential to achieve the best obstetric outcome possible .\\n\\nPregnancy in patients with BEG__underlying cirrhosis__END represents a major challenge , in which safety and ideal management remain largely unknown .\n",

related workload in three male children with BEG__left ventricular outflow tract__END ( LVOT ) BEG__obstruction__END during alpine skiing .\\nSpirometric data ( VO2 ) and BEG__heart rate__END ( HR ) were monitored during alpine skiing in various terrains according to the subject ’ s performance level .\\nA BEG__portable spirometric device__END was used for on - slope data sampling .\\nBEG__Relative workload__END was calculated in relation to peak cardiorespiratory values , obtained during an incremental laboratory cycle test .\\nOn the slope the subjects reached 78 % to 103 % of their BEG__peak ergometric HR__END and a BEG__VO2peak__END of 65 % to 100 % .\\nYoung beginners and intermediates with BEG__LVOT obstruction__END seem to face a high cardiorespiratory stress during alpine skiing .\\nFor the beginner , an BEG__additional load__END is seen during uphill sidestepping with skis .\\nIn children suffering from BEG__congenital heart disease__END , physiological aspects of sports activities such as skiing should not be viewed separately from the possibilities of sports participation and social interactions .\\n\\nBACKGROUND\\n\\nChildren with BEG__obstruction of left ventricular outflow tract__END bear a higher risk of BEG__sudden ventricular arrhythmia__END or BEG__death__END due to BEG__myocardial ischaemia__END .\\nBy contrast , adapted physical activity provides health benefits such as cardioprotective effects , especially in children with BEG__disabilities__END .\\nFurthermore , motor activity in peer groups is a basic necessity for the social development of children who run the risk of being overprotected by parents and isolated from daily activities due to their BEG__congenital heart defect__END .\\n\\nThese physiological and motivational benefits make disease - specific outdoor activity classes increasingly interesting for prevention and BEG__rehabilitation__END in the young .\\nThe popularity of skiing , the outdoor scenery and the social environment have made winter sports and alpine skiing classes especially attractive for children with BEG__congenital heart disease__END .\\n5 However , the in - field cardiorespiratory workload in this target group is not well known .\\n\\nTo objectively assess the BEG__pulmonary and circulatory workload__END in medium risk patients , this BEG__study__END evaluated the relative BEG__individual O2 volume__END ( VO2 ) and BEG__heart rate__END of three boys with BEG__left ventricular outflow tract__END ( LVOT ) BEG__obstruction__END during alpine skiing .\\n\\nCASE PRESENTATION\\n\\nInformed consent by the children and their parents to participate in the BEG__study__END was obtained .\\nTesting took place in the Austrian Kleinwalsertal skiing region near Riezlern , located 1150 to 2000 m above sea level .\\nWeather conditions comprised partly cloudy skies and BEG__temperatures__END between − 2 and + 4 ° C .\\nThe subject ’ s skiing ability was graded by licensed ski instructors , considering years of skiing experience .\\nDuring the alpine skiing field tests , different slopes and various terrains were used according to individual performance levels .\\n\\nBeginner\\n\\nThe medical history of the beginner ( 11 years old , 49.3 kg , 154 cm , BEG__body mass index__END ( BMI ) 20.7 kg / m2 , age - adjusted P75 , no BEG__skiing experience ) features a transposition of the great arteries__END with BEG__subpulmonary stenosis__END and BEG__ventricular septal defect__END ( Taussig – Bing anomaly ) and a BEG__high - grade preductal aortic coarctation__END .\\nHe underwent BEG__surgical resection__END and BEG__end - to - end anastomosis of the coarctation__END at the age of 3 months .\\nBEG__Switch operation of the great arteries__END and BEG__closure of the septal defect__END was performed at the age of 14 months .\\nThe BEG__gradient over the left ventricular outflow tract__END was 30 mm Hg at rest and rose to 45 mm Hg with BEG__intravenous application of orciprenalin__END .\\nBEG__Systolic left ventricular pressure__END at this time was 145 mm Hg .\\nBEG__Echocardiography__END showed no signs of BEG__left ventricular hypertrophy__END .\\n\\nIntermediate\\n\\nThe BEG__intermediate skier__END ( 10 years old , 38.3 kg , 140 cm , BEG__BMI__END 19.5 kg / m2 , age - adjusted P60 , with a total of 2 – 3 weeks of skiing experience ) was born with a BEG__bicuspid aortic valve__END and underwent BEG__commisurotomy__END due to BEG__high - grade stenosis__END ( 110 mm Hg ) of the aortic valve at the age of 18 months .\\nAt the time of investigation the gradient over LVOT was 50 mm Hg at rest .\\nThe BEG__left ventricular myocardium__END showed no BEG__hypertrophy__END .\\n\\nAdvanced\\n\\nThe advanced skier ( 16 years old , 56 kg , 176 cm , BEG__BMI__END 18.1 kg / m2 , 8 kg below P50 , two seasons of skiing experience ) demonstrated with a BEG__resting LVOT gradient__END of 33 mm Hg and a BEG__first - grade insufficiency of the aortic valve__END .\\nBEG__Shortening fraction__END was within normal range ( 38 % ) and BEG__electrocardiography__END ( ECG ) showed sinus rhythm .\\nBEG__Stress ECG__END ( treadmill ) at a BEG__recent routine check - up before the skiing excursions__END was stopped due to exhaustion without any BEG__signs of ischaemia__END .\\nThere was no BEG__surgical or interventional repair of the aortic valve__END performed until now .\\n\\nINVESTIGATIONS\\n\\nAll subjects performed a laboratory and a BEG__field test__END on the third ( ergometer test ) and fourth ( field ) day of the visit , after BEG__altitude acclimatisation__END .\\n\\nBEG__Field test__END\\n\\nA BEG__portable spirometric device__END ( Oxycon Mobile ;\\nJaeger , Hoechberg , Germany ) was used for on - slope data sampling including breath - by - breath detection of the BEG__ventilation__END and BEG__beat - to - beat heart rate via chest belt__END ( Polar , Kempele , Finland ) .\\nBefore each test and at least 30 min after the BEG__equipment__END had been turned on , BEG__turbine calibration__END was performed with 0.2 and 2 litre / min of air and BEG__gas analysers__END were calibrated against outside air and BEG__standard gas__END ( 16 % O2 , BEG__5 % CO2__END ) .\\nAn internal altitude adapted recalibration is performed every 10 s .\\n\\nThe measuring units of the BEG__Oxycon Mobile__END were carried in a small rucksack on the back of the subjects .\\nAccording to the manufacturer , the BEG__device__END provides accurate results at temperatures between − 10 and + 50 ° C , up to an altitude of 5500 m above sea level and humidity between 10 % and 95 % .\\n\\nTo allocate the different skiing manoeuvres ( downhill skiing , BEG__uphill walking__END with BEG__skis__END , T - bar use ) to the physiological data , BEG__synchronous digital video recording__END was performed and the BEG__elevation__END above sea level was monitored via a BEG__Polar heart rate monitor__END ( Model S710 , Polar , Kempele , Finland ) during the trial .\\n\\nBEG__Laboratory test__END\\n\\nTo calculate the relative workload , the individual peak cardiorespiratory capacity was measured during an BEG__incremental exercise test__END on an BEG__electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer__END ( ergo control 500 ;\\nDaum Electronic , Fuerth , Germany ) , 1 day before the BEG__field test__END at the same geographical altitude using the BEG__identical spirometric device__END .\\nSubjects started with a resistance of about 1 W / kg bodyweight , which was increased by 0.5 W / kg every 3 min until BEG__volitional fatigue__END .\\n\\nVO2 ( litre / min ) and BEG__heart rate ( HR ) ( beats / min )__END were collected throughout the BEG__exercise test__END as described above .\\nBEG__VO2peak__END was expressed as the highest 30 - s average value obtained during the test .\\n\\nOUTCOME AND FOLLOW - UP\\n\\nSubjects completed 3 – 5 steps during the BEG__incremental cycle ergometer test__END .\\nIn all subjects , primary and secondary criteria for BEG__maximal oxygen uptake__END ( VO2 plateau , BEG__respiratory exchange ratio__END & gt ; 1.1 ) were not met .\\n\\nThe data of the BEG__incremental test__END as well as peak and mean values of the BEG__field test__END are shown in table 1\\n\\nBEG__Peak values__END and performance data of the laboratory and the field tests according to different movement patterns\\n\\nBeginner\\n\\nAccording to the BEG__video data__END of representative skiing sessions , the beginner spent approximately 20 % of the total time skiing , 45 % hiking on skis and 35 % resting while following practical demonstrations and verbal advice given by the instructor .\\n\\nIntermediate\\n\\nThe intermediate had to run a defined slope with an BEG__easy second part__END .\\nAfter a short walk on skis he used a T - bar to come up to the starting point .\\nAfter the ski lift he had to walk 40 m uphill to reach the place where the equipment ( mask and chest belt ) was removed .\\n\\nAdvanced\\n\\nThe advanced skier had to cope with a challenging slope that can be divided into two steep sections with an easy part in between .\\nBEG__Peak values__END were obtained on the second steep and mogul - shaped slope .\\nA chair lift was used for uphill transportation .\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nChildren with BEG__congenital heart defects__END are given a great deal of parental attention .\\nOverprotectiveness may lead to BEG__social withdrawal and feelings of isolation4__END or inferiority , causing a BEG__reduction in physical activity__END and BEG__further retraction__END from peers .\\nHowever , physical activity can play a decisive role in the psychosocial development since it encourages independence and new experiences , which can alter a child ’ s sense of control and competence .\\nSports participation might also enable the child to better cope with the BEG__disease__END - specific uncertainty .\\n9\\n\\nIn accordance to the individual performance level of the BEG__study participants__END , the slopes varied from BEG__flattened terrain to challenging mogul - shaped runs__END .\\nAlthough the beginner spent one third of the outdoor recording time resting and listening to the skiing instructor , he experienced BEG__profound physical stress__END during exercises such as uphill hiking , forward pushing by poles and sideway stepping .\\nTo some extent , this may also explain the somewhat lower cardiorespiratory output of the intermediate skier .\\n\\nBesides these interpersonal differences , it could be seen from the results on the slope , that VO2peak and HRpeak values reached ( or BEG__slightly exceeded__END ) the corresponding maxima collected during the BEG__ergometer test__END .\\nA few reasons have to be drawn into account for these findings .\\nFirst , VO2peak and HRpeak are dependent upon the mode of the BEG__incremental ergometer test__END .\\nFor example , peak values of BEG__VO2__END and HR , when attained by cycle ergometry , are lower than the respective parameters collected during treadmill - running .\\nSecond , the varying muscle contraction patterns ( BEG__dynamic vs quasi-isometric contraction__END ) : the BEG__incremental test__END on the bicycle leads to an BEG__anaerobic - lactic exhaustion of the muscles__END , while peak values during skiing and walking with skis mainly result from BEG__short bouts of alactic muscle activity__END .\\nSince the energy metabolism of children is characterised by BEG__lower enzyme activity of the anaerobic glycolysis__END , their ability for BEG__long lasting high - intensity muscle activity__END is reduced , possibly resulting in an underestimation of the cardiorespiratory capacity .\\nSince outdoor data was gathered on public ski slopes during regular operation hours , external influences such as BEG__overtaking__END or crossing skiers as well as exposure to cold13 may also have affected physiological responses .\\n\\nDue to the anatomical origin of the coronary arteries beyond the aortic valve , BEG__high - grade stenosis of the left ventricular outflow tract__END can lead to BEG__myocardial ischaemia__END during physical exercise .\\nTherefore , health professionals recommend the avoidance of competitive sports that involve BEG__high dynamic and static muscular demands__END , and suggest a BEG__medical evaluation__END including an BEG__exercise test__END before the beginning of cardiovascular training or BEG__athletic__END workout .\\nRecommendations from the Task Force 2 for Congenital Heart Disease15 suggest a graded permission ( dependent on history , BEG__stress ECG__END , exercise tolerance , echocardiographic and catheterisation findings ) , including the allowance for all exercises in the case of a BEG__pressure gradient__END below 30 mm Hg ( peak - to - BEG__peak systolic gradient__END , measured via catheterisation ) and a BEG__moderate to high limitation of physical activity__END with a BEG__gradient__END between 30 and 50 mm Hg .\\nChildren with a BEG__stenosis__END with a BEG__pressure gradient__END higher than 50 mm Hg ( severe ) should reduce exercises to a BEG__low grade leisure activity__END .\\n\\nHowever , from the experience of more than 100 children with BEG__congenital heart disease__END , participating in skiing under supervision of doctors and skiing instructors provides an enjoyable leisure time experience within an environment that allows impaired children to participate and succeed in a range of challenging activities .\\nBy noticing improvements in sports activities , self - esteem may renascent and yield to reinforcement of motion - derived self - education .\\nIn the same manner , physical exercise with peers represents a valuable basis to improve social competence .\n",
      "6  Summary\\n\\nA 75 - year old - female was referred with BEG__chest pain__END .\\nShe was fully investigated and it was felt that her BEG__symptoms__END were non-cardiac .\\nFour months later , she was seen in gastroenterology outpatients with BEG__bloody diarrhoea__END and BEG__abdominal pain__END .\\nBEG__Colonoscopy__END demonstrated BEG__inflammation up to the splenic flexure__END and histology confirmed BEG__inflammatory colitis__END .\\nLater , she developed BEG__dyspepsia__END and BEG__weight loss__END .\\nAn BEG__oesophagogastroduodenoscopy__END ( OGD ) showed BEG__Helicobacter pylori negative erosive gastritis__END with a BEG__benign duodenal ulcer__END .\\nBEG__Whole body CT scan__END was normal .\\nTen months later , she was admitted with BEG__dyspnoea__END due to BEG__severe heart failure__END .\\nThe BEG__admission ECG__END had significantly changed , now showing BEG__low voltage complexes__END and BEG__repeat echocardiography__END showed BEG__restrictive cardiomyopathy__END .\\nBEG__Specific congo red staining__END on the BEG__biopsy specimens from the previous OGD__END and BEG__colonoscopy__END confirmed BEG__amyloid deposits__END .\\nBEG__Further investigations__END detected an BEG__underlying light chain myeloma__END causing systemic ( AL ) BEG__amyloidosis__END .\\nUnfortunately , her condition deteriorated rapidly and she died shortly afterwards .\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nFrom this case report , we want to highlight that BEG__primary AL amyloidosis of the gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract may mimic idiopathic inflammatory colitis__END .\\nSeveral case reports are published of BEG__AL amyloidosis__END , presenting as BEG__ischaemic colitis__END , BEG__collagenous colitis__END , BEG__GI bleeding__END , BEG__intestinal obstruction__END and BEG__malignancy__END .\\n1 , – , 6 There is only one case report in which it presented as BEG__inflammatory ( ulcerative ) colitis__END .\\n\\nGastroenterologists should consider BEG__amyloidosis__END in the differential diagnosis of older patients presenting with BEG__diarrhoea__END , despite the BEG__endoscopy__END and histology suggesting BEG__idiopathic colitis__END .\\n\\nCardiologists should consider BEG__amyloidosis__END in patients with BEG__low voltage QRS pattern__END on BEG__12 - lead ECG__END and BEG__restrictive left ventricular function__END on BEG__echocardiography__END .\\nThis patient originally presented with BEG__non-cardiac chest pain__END and at the time the BEG__12 - lead ECG__END , BEG__echocardiogram__END and BEG__coronary angiogram__END done were all felt to be within normal limits .\\n\\nThis case report should increase the awareness of BEG__amyloidosis__END presenting as BEG__colitis__END and its BEG__characteristic endoscopic features__END and prompt specific staining requests for BEG__amyloid__END on BEG__histological specimens__END .\\n\\nCase presentation\\n\\nA 75 - year - old lady presented to the gastroenterology outpatient department with a 2 - month history of BEG__loose stools__END associated with BEG__fresh blood__END and BEG__abdominal pain__END .\\nShe had no BEG__previous bowel conditions__END , BEG__recent treatment__END with BEG__antibiotics__END or travel abroad .\\nHer general health was good and her BEG__weight__END was stable with a BEG__body mass index__END of 30 kg / m2 .\\nShe was taking regular BEG__atenolol__END 25 mg and BEG__simvastatin__END 20 mg , prescribed by her general practitioner for BEG__hypertension__END and BEG__hypercholesterolaemia__END respectively .\\nShe did not use BEG__over the counter aspirin__END , BEG__non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs__END or BEG__complementary medicines__END .\\n\\nThe only other significant medical history included normal investigations for BEG__chest pain__END 4 months earlier .\\nHer cardiac risk factors included : BEG__hypercholesterolaemia__END , BEG__hypertension__END , previous smoking and a positive family history of BEG__premature coronary heart disease__END .\\nThere was no family history of BEG__inflammatory bowel disease__END or BEG__bowel cancer__END .\\nShe lived with her husband and was mobile and independent .\\n\\nBEG__General physical and systemic examination__END was normal including a BEG__rectal examination__END and BEG__rigid sigmoidoscopy__END .\\n\\nFollowing the consultation , she underwent a BEG__colonoscopy and biopsy__END which showed BEG__idiopathic inflammatory colitis__END .\\nShe was prescribed BEG__5 - aminosalicylates__END ( BEG__5 - ASA__END ) , which improved her BEG__symptoms__END .\\nAt follow - up , she was noted to have lost weight prompting further investigations including BEG__whole body CT scan__END , small bowel meal and follow through and BEG__upper GI endoscopy__END .\\n\\nIn February 2010 , the patient was admitted with BEG__severe heart failure__END and BEG__bilateral pleural effusions__END , confirmed on BEG__chest x-ray__END .\\n\\nInvestigations\\n\\nThe BEG__initial cardiac investigations__END , done 4 months before presentation in gastroenterology outpatient were all normal and included : BEG__12 - lead ECG__END ( figure 1A ) with normal BEG__voltage QRS complexes__END .\\nBEG__Echocardiography__END demonstrated normal left ventricular systolic function and selective coronary arteriography showed normal coronary arteries .\\n\\nBEG__Routine blood tests__END done on first presentation in gastroenterology clinic , including BEG__full blood count__END , BEG__urea__END , BEG__electrolytes__END , BEG__creatinine__END , BEG__liver function tests__END and BEG__inflammatory markers__END ( erythrocyte sedimentation rate and BEG__C reactive protein )__END were normal .\\nA BEG__urine dipstick__END showed BEG__few leucocytes__END but no BEG__proteinuria__END .\\n\\nAn BEG__outpatient colonoscopy__END , which was performed 5 months after her initial presentation with BEG__chest pain__END and 10 months before her final presentation with BEG__heart failure__END , showed BEG__moderately severe colitis__END up to splenic flexure .\\nBEG__Further advancement of the scope__END was abandoned due to severity of BEG__inflammation__END ( figure 2A , B ) .\\nThe mucosa was BEG__uniformly inflamed__END and oedematous with BEG__contact bleeding__END and there were BEG__several apthous ulcers in the sigmoid colon__END .\\nOn retrospective review of the BEG__images__END taken during the BEG__colonoscopy__END , there appeared to be a BEG__small submucosal haematoma in the sigmoid colon__END .\\nHistology confirmed the diagnosis of BEG__acute focally active chronic inflammatory colitis__END with rectal sparing .\\n\\nA BEG__CT scan of her chest , abdomen and pelvis__END was reported as showing BEG__featureless__END , BEG__thickened sigmoid colon__END with no BEG__other abnormalities__END to account for the BEG__weight loss__END .\\nA BEG__subsequent small bowel meal__END was also reported normal .\\nBEG__Upper GI endoscopy__END revealed BEG__Helicobacter pylori negative erosive gastritis__END and a BEG__small benign duodenal ulcer__END ( figure 2C ) .\\nThe BEG__gastric and duodenal biopsies__END excluded BEG__Crohn ’ s disease__END and other conditions such as BEG__coeliac disease__END .\\n\\nLater on , when she presented with BEG__heart failure__END , the BEG__admission ECG__END had significantly changed with BEG__1st degree heart block__END , BEG__low voltage QRS complexes__END and BEG__right axis deviation__END ( figure 1B ) .\\nBEG__Repeat echocardiogram__END now showed BEG__thickened left ventricular muscle__END with BEG__mildly impaired systolic contraction__END but a BEG__markedly restrictive filling pattern__END on BEG__Doppler ultrasound__END : an E : A BEG__ratio__END of 2.4 and a MV deceleration time of 165 ms ( figure 1C , D ) .\\nA BEG__bright speckled echogenic appearance__END was noted , mainly affecting the interventricular septum .\\nBEG__CT angiography__END did not show any BEG__significant coronary artery disease__END .\\nThese BEG__findings__END were consistent with a BEG__severe restrictive cardiomyopathy__END and were considered highly suspicious for BEG__amyloidosis__END .\\n\\nAt this stage , review of BEG__all previous histology__END was requested , specifically looking for BEG__amyloid deposition__END .\\nBEG__Congo red staining of all the histology specimens__END from the BEG__previous colonoscopy__END 10 months earlier and BEG__oesophagogastroduodenoscopy__END 3 months earlier was carried out .\\nThese clearly demonstrated typical birefringence pattern under polarised light consistent with the diagnosis of BEG__amyloid deposits__END ( figure 3 ) .\\nBEG__Urine sample__END was positive for BEG__Bence - Jones proteins__END and BEG__plasma protein electrophoresis__END confirmed κ BEG__light chains__END at a concentration of 383 mg / l and κ / λ ratio of 45.3 units , consistent with the diagnosis of BEG__underlying myeloma__END .\\nA BEG__bone marrow biopsy__END confirmed BEG__plasma cell dyscrasia__END and a BEG__skeletal survey__END showed a BEG__single myeloma deposit in the left upper femoral shaft__END .\\n\\nDifferential diagnosis\\n\\nThis patient had clinical and endoscopic features of BEG__inflammatory bowel disease__END and the differential diagnosis at that time included : BEG__infective , ischaemic and drug related colitis__END and BEG__other rare conditions__END such as BEG__tuberculosis__END , BEG__lymphoma__END and BEG__amyloidosis__END .\\nThe secondary presentation of BEG__heart failure__END due to BEG__restrictive cardiomyopathy__END was suspicious of BEG__cardiac amyloidosis__END but the differential diagnosis includes BEG__sarcoidosis__END , BEG__haemochromatosis__END and BEG__malignant infiltrative disorders__END .\\n\\nBEG__Treatment__END\\n\\nThis patient was initially treated for BEG__idiopathic inflammatory colitis__END with BEG__5 - ASA__END to which she responded and did not need BEG__oral steroids__END .\\nAt follow - up , she underwent BEG__further investigations__END for BEG__weight loss__END and BEG__dyspepsia__END and was given a BEG__proton pump inhibitor__END in the form of BEG__omeprazole__END 20 mg once daily .\\n\\nWhen she was admitted as an emergency with BEG__new onset heart failure__END , she was treated with BEG__intravenous frusemide__END 40 mg twice daily and later BEG__oral bumetanide__END 1 mg once daily .\\nShe also received an BEG__ACE inhibitor__END in the form of BEG__enalapril__END 2.5 mg once daily .\\nDuring this admission , she developed BEG__recurrent severe diarrhoea__END and was started on BEG__intravenous hydrocortisine__END 100 mg four times a day , which improved her BEG__diarrhoea symptoms__END .\\n\\nA multidisciplinary team with involvement of cardiology , gastroenterology , BEG__pathology__END and BEG__haematology__END were involved in her management .\\nOnce the diagnosis of BEG__myeloma__END and BEG__amyloidosis__END was established , she was treated with BEG__dexamethasone__END 20 mg once daily , BEG__thalidomide__END 50 mg once daily and anticoagulated with BEG__warfarin__END .\\n\\nOutcome and follow - up\\n\\nUnfortunately , she responded poorly to BEG__treatment__END of BEG__heart failure__END and BEG__conventional treatment__END for BEG__multiple myeloma__END .\\nThe BEG__cardiac involvement__END resulted in BEG__progressive heart failure__END and BEG__hypotension__END .\\nAfter consultation with the patient and family , BEG__further active treatment__END was withdrawn and she was transferred to a hospice for BEG__palliative care__END where she died shortly afterwards .\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nBEG__Amyloidosis__END is defined as an extracellular deposit of BEG__protein fibrils__END with a β sheet fibrillar structure and characteristic properties after staining with BEG__congo red dye__END .\\nIt is a BEG__rare disease__END with reported incidence of 1 – 5 cases per 100 000 .\\nBEG__Deposition of amyloid throughout the body__END , termed BEG__systemic amyloidosis__END , causes BEG__multi organ failure__END and carries a poor prognosis .\\nThe mortality is mainly caused by BEG__cardiac and renal complications__END .\\nPrimary ( AL ) or BEG__light chain ( L ) associated AL amyloidosis__END is the most common form with BEG__generalised deposition of excess light chains__END .\\n\\nThe published literature ( Embase , MEDLINE ) , reports several cases of primary ( AL ) BEG__amyloidosis__END presenting as : BEG__ischaemic colitis__END , BEG__collagenous colitis__END , BEG__acute GI bleeding__END , BEG__intestinal obstruction__END and BEG__malignancy__END .\\n1 , – , 6 Only one case report exists , where BEG__AL amyloidosis__END presented as BEG__inflammatory ( ulcerative ) colitis__END .\\nThe aim of reporting this case report is to improve awareness of the BEG__non-specific GI presentation of primary ( AL ) amyloidosis__END which can BEG__mimic colitis__END , so that an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the BEG__underlying plasma cell dyscrasia__END can be given and improve outcome .\\n\\nPrimary ( AL ) BEG__amyloidosis__END is commonly associated with BEG__plasma cell dyscrasia__END of which 15 % have BEG__multiple myeloma__END .\\n8 , – , 10 Secondary ( AA ) BEG__amyloidosis__END with BEG__acute phase reactant serum amyloid A protein__END ( A ) is associated with infectious , BEG__inflammatory__END or less commonly , BEG__neoplastic disorders__END .\\nWith the widespread use of BEG__antibiotics__END and BEG__anti-inflammatory medications__END , the predominant type of amyloid in the western world has shifted from BEG__secondary ( AA ) amyloidosis__END to primary ( AL ) BEG__amyloidosis__END .\\nOther recognised types of amyloid include : patients undergoing BEG__long - term haemodialysis__END with deposits of β2 - microglobulin1112 ;\\nBEG__hereditary amyloidosis__END ( an BEG__autosomal dominant inheritance of amyloidogenic proteins__END ) and BEG__Senile amyloidosis__END is found in 10 – 36 % of patients over 80 years old and occasionally in younger individuals .\\n910\\n\\nIn primary ( AL ) BEG__type amyloidosis GI tract involvement__END is nearly universal ; and 30 – 60 % of these patients develop BEG__common GI symptoms__END .\\nBEG__Untreated AL amyloidosis__END carries a median 1 - year survival of approximately 50 % , which makes early diagnosis and BEG__treatment__END important .\\n\\nPresentations are often non-specific and include BEG__GI bleeding__END , BEG__gut dysmotility__END leading to BEG__pseudo-obstruction__END , BEG__vomiting__END , BEG__dysphagia__END and BEG__malabsorption__END due to BEG__secondary bacterial overgrowth__END .\\nMost of these BEG__symptoms__END result from BEG__infiltrative and ischaemic changes__END caused by BEG__accumulation of amyloid in confined tissue spaces in bowel and blood vessel walls__END .\\nBEG__More rarely massive amyloid deposition__END can cause BEG__pseudotumours__END known as BEG__amyloidomas__END that can cause BEG__bowel obstruction__END .\\n\\nSimilar to the clinical presentation , the endoscopic findings are BEG__non-specific in AL amyloidosis__END .\\nFindings described include : macroglosia ;\\nBEG__atonia / achalsia in oesophagus__END and BEG__thickened folds__END ;\\nBEG__erosions__END , BEG__friability__END , BEG__ulcerations__END and BEG__polyps in stomach__END and small bowel .\\n13 , – , 17 Colonic findings are described as typical feature of BEG__idiopathic colitis__END including : BEG__mucosal oedema__END , BEG__loss of haustrations__END , BEG__luminal narrowing__END or BEG__thick folds__END ;\\nBEG__ulceration__END and BEG__mucosal nodularity__END with BEG__specific submucosal haematomas__END .\\n27 , – , 10 This patient had what looks like a BEG__small but characteristic submucosal haematoma__END , which was not recognised by the endoscopist , while other endoscopic findings were non-specific ( figure 2A – C ) .\\n\\nA high degree of clinical suspicion is needed to make an early diagnosis of BEG__amyloidosis__END in order to prevent BEG__multisystem damage__END .\\n910 This patient presented with BEG__typical non-specific symptoms__END and responded to BEG__standard treatment__END of BEG__idiopathic inflammatory colitis__END .\\nIt was only when she represented with BEG__heart failure__END and BEG__repeat cardiac investigations__END suggested BEG__restrictive cardiomyopathy__END that BEG__amyloidosis__END was considered .\\n\\nThe goal of BEG__treatment__END in BEG__AL amyloidosis__END is to suppress the synthesis of BEG__immunoglobulin light chains__END by controlling the BEG__underlying plasma cell disorder__END with BEG__chemotherapy__END .\\nRecently , BEG__high - dose chemotherapy__END with BEG__haematopoietic stem cell transplantation__END is being performed in BEG__AL amyloidosis__END , with encouraging results but this is limited to patients with good performance status and who have only BEG__limited cardiac involvement__END .\\n1819 Patients need BEG__maximum supportive treatment__END to prevent BEG__multi-organ damage__END and BEG__complications__END associated with BEG__immunosuppression__END .\\n\\nOur patient was unfortunately not considered fit for a BEG__bone marrow transplant__END because she presented with BEG__advanced systemic ( AL ) primary amyloidosis__END with BEG__significant cardiac involvement__END and BEG__poor performance status__END .\\n18 The BEG__underlying myeloma__END was treated with BEG__dexamethasone__END and BEG__thalidomide__END , but due to BEG__widespread disease__END and BEG__systemic involvement__END she failed to respond to the BEG__conventional treatment__END , developing BEG__progressive heart failure__END and BEG__death__END .\n",

                  Description\\n\\nA 22 - year - old Bangladeshi man presented to a London district general hospital with a 2 month history of BEG__abdominal pain__END , BEG__weight loss__END , BEG__fever__END and BEG__difficulty in walking__END .\\nHis medical history was significant for BEG__cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis__END and he had recently been stepped - down from BEG__quadruple therapy__END with BEG__rifampicin__END , BEG__isoniazid__END , BEG__ethambutol__END and BEG__pyrazinamide__END to BEG__dual therapy__END with BEG__rifampicin__END and BEG__isoniazid__END .\\nOn admission , he was BEG__febrile__END and BEG__tachycardic__END .\\nBEG__Examination__END revealed BEG__generalised abdominal tenderness__END with a palpable , BEG__fluctuant right flank mass__END .\\nBEG__Inflammatory markers__END were raised ( BEG__C reactive protein__END 287 mg / l , BEG__erythrocyte sedimentation rate__END 121 mm / h ) with a normal BEG__white cell count__END ( 9.4 × 109 / l ) and BEG__normocytic anaemia__END ( haemoglobin 9.3 g / dl ) .\\nAn BEG__abdominal CT__END was performed which demonstrated a BEG__large right - sided psoas abscess__END measuring 110 × 190 × 80 mm with BEG__superior displacement of the right kidney__END ( figure 1 ) .\\nNo BEG__vertebral disease__END was seen .\\n\\nBEG__Contrast - enhanced CT scans in ( A ) the coronal plane and ( B ) the transverse plane__END , demonstrating a BEG__large right - sided psoas abscess__END measuring 110 × 190 × 80 mm .\\nThere is BEG__superolateral displacement of the ipsilateral kidney__END , obliterating the BEG__hepato - renal recess__END .\\nThere is no evidence of BEG__lumbar involvement__END and the BEG__contralateral psoas major muscle__END is unaffected .\\nBEG__Low attenuation lesions within the spleen__END may represent BEG__splenic abscesses__END .\\n\\nThe patient was treated with BEG__ultrasound - guided percutaneous drainage__END and was restarted on BEG__quadruple therapy__END , with a good symptomatic relief .\\nA total volume of 1200 ml was drained .\\n\\nBEG__Mycobacterial psoas abscess__END is typically associated with BEG__spinal tuberculosis__END due to the extension of BEG__infection__END from lumbar vertebrae .\\nHowever , as in this patient , a BEG__psoas abscess__END may occur in the absence of BEG__spinal disease__END .\\nThis is either secondary to BEG__direct invasion__END from other adjacent structures or from haematogenous spread .\\nBEG__Abdominal CT__END is the BEG__principal imaging modality__END for the diagnosis of BEG__psoas abscess__END , 2 but BEG__ultrasound__END is also useful for BEG__drain insertion__END and for monitoring resolution .\\nBEG__Percutaneous drainage__END combined with BEG__antituberculous therapy__END is usually sufficient for treatment ;\\npatients rarely require BEG__open surgical drainage__END .\n",

                                              Summary\\n\\nA 34 - year - old 13 - week pregnant woman presented with BEG__hypertension__END refractory to BEG__medical therapy__END and on BEG__workup__END was found to have a BEG__right adrenal mass__END .\\nDue to her BEG__persistent increased blood pressure__END she was advised BEG__urinary vanillylmandelic acid__END ( VMA ) and its BEG__level__END was raised .\\nBEG__MRI of the abdomen__END showed a BEG__well - circumcised lesion in the right adrenal__END of 3.0 × 2.5 cm suggestive of BEG__pheochromocytoma__END .\\nThe patient was started on BEG__antihypertensives__END including α - blockers and β - blockers and planned for BEG__right open adrenalectomy__END .\\nIntraoperatively , BEG__blood pressure__END was raised up to 180 / 110 mm Hg on BEG__slight manipulation of adrenal gland__END which was controlled with BEG__glyceryl - trinitrate__END and BEG__volatile agents__END .\\nBEG__Postoperatively urinary VMA__END decreased to normal range and BEG__all antihypertensives__END were gradually stopped .\\nShe had uneventful pregnancy and delivered vaginally .\\nThis case report highlights the importance of BEG__surgical management__END of BEG__pheochromocytoma__END in second trimester of pregnancy to avoid BEG__catastrophic complications__END later in pregnancy .\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nBEG__Pheochromocytoma__END ( PCC ) is a BEG__neuroendocrine tumour of the adrenal medulla__END ( originating in the chromaffin cells ) .\\nPCC is a very rare condition in pregnancy and it carries significant risks to the mother as well as to the fetus .\\nTherefore , PCC should be considered as a possible cause of BEG__refractory hypertension in pregnancy__END and appropriate investigations should be carried out .\\nThe diagnosis can be established by measuring BEG__catecholamines__END and BEG__metanephrines levels__END in the BEG__plasma__END ( blood ) or through a 24 - hour BEG__urine collection for VMA__END .\\nThe BEG__tumour__END is generally localised by BEG__MRI__END during pregnancy .\\nBEG__Definitive treatment__END of PCC is surgical but initially it should be treated medically to control BEG__blood pressure__END with α - BEG__adrenergic blockers__END , followed by β - blockers .\\nIn this case report PCC was detected in the second trimester , and managed successfully .\\n\\nCase presentation\\n\\nA 34 - year pregnant woman was referred to our clinic because of BEG__hypertension__END refractory to BEG__medical therapy__END and BEG__right adrenal mass__END .\\nShe had two normal deliveries before this pregnancy and had no BEG__complications__END .\\nShe was diagnosed to have BEG__essential hypertension__END when non-pregnant and was prescribed BEG__ACE inhibitor__END ( enalapril 10 mg twice daily ) .\\nBEG__Calcium channel blocker__END and BEG__β - blocker__END ( amlodipine 10 mg four times a day and BEG__atenolol__END 50 mg twice daily ) were later added by the family physician due to BEG__refractory hypertension__END .\\nMeanwhile , the patient became pregnant .\\n\\nInvestigations\\n\\nOwing to BEG__persistent increased blood pressure__END ( BP ) she was advised BEG__urinary vanillylmandelic acid__END ( VMA ) which was raised 30 mg / 24 h ( normal level 2 – 7 mg / 24 h ) . Later the family physician advised BEG__ultrasound__END which revealed an BEG__adrenal mass__END .\\nShe had an BEG__MRI__END subsequently which confirmed a well - BEG__circumscibed lesion in the right adrenal mass__END of 3.0 × 2.5 cm suggestive of PCC ( figures 1 and 2 ) .\\n\\nDifferential diagnosis\\n\\nBEG__Hypertension__END during pregnancy is usually attributable to BEG__pre-eclampsia__END ( pregnancy - induced hypertension ) or BEG__chronic hypertension__END but secondary causes of BEG__hypertension__END should be considered in patients refractory to BEG__medical therapy__END .\\nThese include BEG__renal vascular hypertension__END , BEG__coarctation of the aorta__END and adrenal causes of BEG__hypertension__END ( BEG__Cushing syndrome__END , BEG__Conn 's syndrome__END , PCC ) .\\n\\nBEG__Treatment__END\\n\\nSoon after these BEG__diagnostic tests__END , the patient developed BEG__symptoms__END including BEG__sweating__END , BEG__flushing__END and BEG__chest pain__END with BEG__BP__END 200 / 120 mm Hg .\\nBEG__Cardiac evaluation__END was performed including BEG__ECG__END and BEG__echocardiogram__END which revealed no BEG__abnormality__END .\\nThe BEG__treatment__END was revised and BEG__phenoxybenzamine__END 10 mg thrice daily was initiated resulting in adequate control of BEG__hypertension__END as well as BEG__symptoms__END .\\nBEG__Obstetric examination__END and BEG__ultrasound of the fetus__END showed a BEG__single alive fetus__END with normal fetal growth parameters .\\nConsidering the risk of BEG__hypertension__END during pregnancy and the possibility of aggravation during later stages of pregnancy we decided to excise the BEG__mass__END .\\nSurgical risk and risk to fetus was discussed with the patient .\\nObstetrician also agreed with the plan and counselled the patient about the possible chances of BEG__miscarriage__END .\\nThe patient was planned for BEG__adrenalectomy__END during 13th week of pregnancy .\\n\\nThe patient was admitted for BEG__right open adrenalectomy__END and started on BEG__progesterone pessaries__END 400 mg twice daily .\\nIntraoperatively , BEG__BP__END raised to 180 / 110 mm Hg on BEG__slight manipulation of adrenal gland__END which was controlled by the anaesthetist with BEG__glyceryl - trinitrate__END and BEG__volatile agents__END included BEG__isoflurane__END and BEG__nitrous__END to control the BEG__BP__END during BEG__surgery__END .\\nOperative time was 160 min with a BEG__blood loss__END of only 200 mL and without any need of BEG__transfusion__END .\\nPostoperatively in the recovery room the obstetrician performed BEG__ultrasound__END and the BEG__fetal heart__END was checked , which was found normal .\\n\\nFor BEG__pain management__END the anaesthetist started BEG__pethidine__END via patient - controlled BEG__intravenous analgesia__END ( PCIA ) .\\nShe was prescribed BEG__intravenous paracetamol__END and BEG__morphine__END after discontinuation of PCIA .\\nThe patient was kept in the intensive care unit for BEG__labile BP__END for 2 days which was managed by BEG__fluid resuscitation__END and adjustment of dosage of BEG__antihypertensives__END .\\nThe endocrinologist gradually tapered off the BEG__antihypertensive medication__END over 3 days postoperatively .\\nOn second postoperative day , slight per BEG__vaginal spotting__END was noticed which settled with observation .\\nThe patient was discharged on seventh POD with BEG__propranolol__END 10 mg twice daily and BEG__progesterone pessaries__END 400 mg twice daily .\\n\\nOutcome and follow - up\\n\\nThe patient was followed up in the clinic after 2 weeks , she was fine with normal fetal growth parameters on BEG__ultrasound__END .\\nBEG__Urinary VMA__END decreased to normal range and BEG__all antihypertensives__END were stopped .\\nShe was followed up in the obstetric clinic , had safe pregnancy and delivered vaginally at term .\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nPCC accounts for 0.1 – 1 % of all cases of BEG__hypertension__END .\\nPrecise incidence in pregnancy is difficult to determine but more than 200 cases have been reported in the published literature .\\nPCC is a BEG__very rare neuroendocrine tumour__END which originates from the BEG__adrenal medulla__END ( chromaffin cells ) .\\nThis BEG__tumour__END is notorious for its devastating consequences .\\nPCC is occasionally referred to as ‘ 10 % tumors ’ because 10 % are bilateral , 10 % are extra-adrenal and 10 % are BEG__malignant__END .\\nIn pregnancy , the presence of PCC may be difficult to detect owing to the more prevalent diagnosis of BEG__pregnancy - induced hypertension__END .\\nIt is usually suspected when patient is not responding well to BEG__antihypertensives__END .\\nBEG__Untreated PCC__END carries a risk of mortality for the mother and the fetus , as high as 58 % .\\nEarly diagnosis is BEG__vital__END and BEG__symptoms__END and signs vary which includes : BEG__hypertension__END ( 98 % of cases ) , BEG__orthostatic hypotension__END , BEG__palpitations__END , BEG__tachycardia__END , BEG__headache__END , BEG__sweating__END , BEG__seizure disorders__END and BEG__anxiety attacks__END .\\nBEG__Other symptoms__END are BEG__chest pain__END , BEG__nausea__END and BEG__vomiting__END , BEG__pallor__END and BEG__flushing__END .\\nPregnancy does not BEG__alter urinary catecholamines__END hence diagnosis is confirmed by 24 h BEG__urine VMA__END , BEG__metanephrines__END or BEG__catecholamines__END .\\nBEG__Metanephrines__END and BEG__catecholamines__END can be measured in the blood as well .\\nIn adults , approximately 80 % of PCC are unilateral and solitary .\\nFor BEG__localisation ultrasound of the abdomen__END should be performed as it is easily accessible , cheap and a BEG__safe modality__END in pregnancy and has 89 – 97 % sensitivity .\\nMR has the advantages of greater accuracy , BEG__high - quality images__END and lack of BEG__ionising radiation__END .\\n9 – 12 As the complication rate increases with progression of BEG__pregnancy__END , late first trimester and second trimester are the ideal times for BEG__surgical treatment__END after BEG__organogenesis__END is completed .\\nBEG__Surgery__END should be avoided in early first trimester because of BEG__high chances of miscarriage__END and in late second trimester and third trimester because of BEG__abdominal exploration__END and access is difficult .\\n12 , 13\\n\\nPCC should always be treated first medically to stabilise the BP and BEG__symptoms__END .\\nα - BEG__Adrenoceptor blockade__END that is either BEG__phenoxybenzamine__END or BEG__prazosin__END and β - blockade is used to control BEG__tachycardia__END and BEG__dysrhythmia__END .\\nThe aim of this pretreatment is twofold : first , before undergoing BEG__surgery__END , BEG__blood pressure__END , BEG__heart rate__END and BEG__volume depletion__END should be restored as far as possible .\\nSecond , the patient should be protected from the BEG__toxic cardiovascular effects__END of BEG__preoperative surges of catecholamines__END .\\nThe definitive treatment of PCC is BEG__surgical excision__END either open , laparoscopic or robotic .\\nA brief literature review showed that patients with BEG__PCC__END during pregnancy were managed with one of the two approaches .\\nFirst , medically up to the end of pregnancy and then BEG__tumour excision__END along with BEG__C section__END .\\nThis approach appears to be more suitable for patients who present late in pregnancy and / or adequately manageable with BEG__antihypertensives__END .\\nThe second approach is BEG__resection of PCC preferably__END during the second trimester .\\nBEG__Robotic adrenalectomy__END during pregnancy has been reported and the patient had no BEG__perioperative complication__END .\\n13 Individualised management is appropriate as no BEG__single protocol__END is suitable for all patients given the rarity and the complexity of the BEG__problem__END .\n",

diverse roles in neuromuscular mechanisms .\\nWithin the cardiovascular system , BEG__hypocalcaemia__END is known to both BEG__impair myocardial contractility__END and BEG__prolong the QT interval__END , BEG__predisposing to ventricular arrhythmias__END .\\nWe present a case of BEG__chronic hypocalcaemia__END with BEG__prolonged QT interval__END associated with an BEG__atrial arrhythmia__END .\\nBEG__Recent studies__END of BEG__congenital long QT syndrome__END suggest there is also a predisposition to BEG__atrial arrhythmias__END .\\nOur case raises the BEG__hypothesis__END that acquired causes of BEG__long QT cause similar repolarisation abnormalities__END that predispose to BEG__atrial arrhythmias__END .\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nCase presentation\\n\\nA 34 - year - old woman presented with a 5 day history of BEG__palpitations__END associated with BEG__dyspnoea__END .\\nShe reported BEG__palpitations__END occurring up to 20 times a day , with episodes lasting between 5 – 30 min .\\nThere had been no BEG__syncopal episodes__END or BEG__collapse__END .\\nCaffeine use was minimal and no other stimulants were being taken .\\nThere was no history of BEG__alcohol excess__END .\\nNo BEG__regular medication__END was taken .\\nShe had undergone BEG__partial thyroidectomy__END in the Philippines , aged 11 years , for a BEG__multinodular goitre__END .\\nOn BEG__examination__END , a BEG__thyroidectomy scar__END was noted and BEG__pronounced dystrophy of the nails__END was present ( fig 1 ) .\\nBEG__Carpopedal spasm__END could be induced using a BEG__sphygmomanometer__END , and Chovstek ’ s sign was present .\\nThe resting pulse was 98 beats / min and BEG__blood pressure__END was 129 / 81 mm Hg .\\n\\nAn BEG__electrocardiogram__END ( ECG ) ( fig 2 ) while in sinus rhythm demonstrated a BEG__corrected QT interval__END ( QTc ) of 503 ms ( normal range ( NR ) for women & lt ; 450 ms ) .\\nAn BEG__outpatient 24 h Holter monitor__END was reported as showing BEG__frequent runs of uncontrolled atrial flutter__END , with BEG__rates__END up to 202 beats / min .\\nThe patient was BEG__symptomatic__END , with BEG__dyspnoea__END and BEG__palpitations__END , during these episodes .\\nBEG__Subsequent ECGs__END and BEG__telemetry__END as an inpatient showed BEG__uncontrolled atrial fibrillation__END ( BEG__AF )__END or BEG__atrial tachyarrhythmia__END ( fig 3 ) .\\nSeveral electrophysiology specialists reviewed the data and felt BEG__AF__END was the BEG__predominant arrhythmia__END present , but BEG__other atrial arrhythmias__END could not be excluded .\\nNo BEG__persistent organised atrial activity__END was noted to suggest BEG__ongoing atrial flutter__END .\\nSome BEG__short bursts of apparently organised atrial activity__END were occasionally seen , but it rapidly degenerated into an BEG__irregularly irregular rhythm__END suggestive of BEG__AF__END .\\nAn BEG__echocardiogram__END showed a BEG__left ventricular end diastolic dimension__END of 54 mm ( NR 39 – 53 mm for women ) .\\nThe left ventricle appeared BEG__mildly hypokinetic__END for a young woman .\\n\\nBEG__Image of three ECGs__END demonstrating an BEG__atrial arrhythmia__END most likely to be BEG__atrial fibrillation__END .\\n\\nBEG__Blood biochemistry__END revealed BEG__Na__END + to be 142 mmol / l , BEG__K__END + 4.3 mmol / l , BEG__urea__END 6.2 mmol / l , and BEG__creatinine__END 61 mmol / l .\\nBEG__Corrected calcium__END was 1.40 mmol / l ( NR 2.2 – 2.6 ) and BEG__albumin__END was normal at 40 g / l .\\nBEG__Magnesium__END was 0.91 mmol / l ( NR 0.7 – 1.0 ) while BEG__organic phosphate__END was 2.02 mmol / l ( NR 0.8 – 1.4 ) . BEG__Endocrine assessment__END showed a BEG__parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) value__END of 1.40 pmol / l ( NR 1.6 – 9.3 ) , BEG__free thyroxine__END ( T4 ) of 10.80 mmol / l ( NR 7.5 – 21.1 ) , and BEG__thyroid stimulating hormone__END ( TSH ) of 2.81 mmol / l ( NR 0.34 – 5.6 ) .\\n\\nA diagnosis of BEG__surgical hypoparathyroidism__END was made .\\nThe patient was reviewed by the endocrinology service and given BEG__intravenous calcium replacement__END ( BEG__calcium gluconate__END 10 mg ) at intervals and BEG__intravenous magnesium supplementation__END .\\nBEG__Oral calcium replacement__END and 1 - α - BEG__calcidol__END were subsequently started .\\nBEG__Long acting cardioselective β - blockers__END were used to help control the BEG__atrial arrhythmia__END and BEG__aspirin__END instigated for BEG__stroke prophylaxis__END .\\nThe BEG__QTc__END was monitored following BEG__oral calcium replacement therapy__END ( fig 4 ) .\\nOnce the BEG__calcium concentration__END was restored to the normal range , BEG__atrial arrhythmias__END resolved and only sinus rhythm was recorded on BEG__Holter monitoring__END .\\n\\nGraph showing improvement in the QTc over time as corrected calcium concentrations improved with BEG__oral calcium replacement__END and 1 - α - calcidol ;\\nthe BEG__blue legends__END show the BEG__corrected calcium concentration at each QTc__END .\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nWhile the BEG__majority of calcium__END in the body is within the skeletal system or BEG__bound to albumin in plasma__END , BEG__free calcium__END is tightly controlled by homeostasis effected by BEG__parathyroid hormone__END ( PTH ) . BEG__Transmembrane gradients in calcium concentration drive membrane excitability in muscles__END , neurones and myocytes .\\nMyocardial contraction is dependent on BEG__extracellular calcium because the myocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum__END can not store sufficient quantities .\\nAs such , prolonged and BEG__significant hypocalcaemia__END can result in BEG__heart failure__END .\\n\\nAmong many causes of BEG__hypocalcaemia__END , BEG__thyroid surgery__END , with the inherent risk of BEG__parathyroid removal__END or BEG__injury__END , is a recognised cause of BEG__hypoparathyroidism__END and subsequent BEG__hypocalcaemia__END .\\nPatients should undergo long term follow - up to ensure this BEG__complication__END does not present at a later date .\\nHere , it presented 23 years after the BEG__initial surgery__END .\\n\\nBEG__Acute cardiomyopathies__END have been induced by BEG__hypocalcaemia__END , and BEG__calcium replacement__END and BEG__vitamin D supplementation__END have been shown to reverse the BEG__heart failure__END .\\nFurthermore , BEG__renal excretion of sodium__END is BEG__partially dependent__END on BEG__intracellular calcium concentrations__END , and BEG__hypocalcaemia__END may encourage salt and water retention , BEG__exacerbating heart failure__END .\\nIn our patient , a BEG__mild left ventricular hypokinesia__END was noted with BEG__chamber dilatation__END .\\nHowever , clinical signs of BEG__heart failure__END did not occur and the BEG__ejection fraction__END remained normal .\\n\\nBEG__Hypocalcaemia__END is a recognised cause of BEG__QT prolongation via prolongation of the plateau phase of the cardiac action__END potential .\\nThis causes calcium ion channels to remain open for a longer period , allowing a BEG__late calcium inflow__END and the formation of early after - depolarisations .\\nIf threshold for depolarisation is reached , new action potentials are induced , initiating a BEG__tachycardia__END and re-entry .\\nBEG__Ventricular arrhythmias__END can follow , in BEG__particular torsades de pointes__END ( TdP ;\\nBEG__polymorphic ventricular tachycardia__END ) and BEG__ventricular fibrillation__END ( BEG__VF__END ) .\\nTherefore , BEG__ventricular arrhythmias__END are a known complication of BEG__hypocalcaemia__END and patients can present with BEG__exertional syncope__END representing BEG__TdP__END and BEG__loss of cardiac output__END .\\n7 – 9\\n\\nIn contrast , BEG__hypercalcaemia__END and BEG__calcium infusions__END have been shown to reduce immediately the QTc with BEG__shortening of the ST segment but prolongation of the T wave__END ;\\nBEG__ventricular ectopics__END are BEG__suppressed__END but BEG__heart block__END and BEG__bradyarrhythmias__END can occur .\\n1 , 4 , 5\\n\\nRecent findings suggest that the disordered repolarisation characteristic of subjects with BEG__congenital long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) occurs in the atria__END as well as the ventricles .\\n10 BEG__Electrophysiological studies__END showed that congenital LQTS patients had BEG__altered atrial electrical conduction__END such that BEG__atrial tachyarrhythmias__END , such as BEG__AF__END , were more easily induced and persisted for longer than in normal or other patients with BEG__AF__END .\\n10 These induced episodes of BEG__AF__END often had a BEG__polymorphic undulating appearance__END , similar to BEG__TdP__END , and have led to the new term of ‘ BEG__atrial torsades__END de pointes ’ .\\n10 Two large studies have shown that early onset of BEG__atrial arrhythmias__END ( BEG__typically AF__END ) is 10-fold higher in those with BEG__genetically proven LQTS__END than the general population or matched controls .\\n11 This coincides with BEG__genetic studies__END that suggest the genes that predispose to LQTS ( KCNQ1 , KCNH2 and BEG__KCNA5 encoded potassium channels__END ) also predispose to BEG__atrial arrhythmia in the general population__END .\\n11\\n\\nThese new developments raise the possibility that long BEG__QTc__END triggered by acquired causes , as presented here , could create the same electrophysiological state present in congenital LQTS which destabilises atrial rhythms to BEG__trigger atrial arrhythmia__END .\\nIt is possible that BEG__hypocalcaemia prolongs atrial repolarisation__END and therefore BEG__triggers atrial arrhythmias__END with ‘ BEG__atrial torsades de pointes__END ’ being the BEG__underlying abnormality__END .\\nThis mechanism may explain the occurrence of BEG__atrial arrhythmia__END in our patient , though the possibility of a BEG__genetic LQTS__END has not formally been excluded .\\nFurthermore , BEG__formal electrophysiological testing__END may be required because a BEG__12 lead ECG__END is unlikely to visualise ‘ BEG__atrial torsades__END de pointes ’ , with most previous reports relying on BEG__electrophysiology studies__END or atrial traces from BEG__automated defibrillators__END .\n"
